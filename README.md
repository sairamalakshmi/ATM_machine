# 🏧 ATM Simulation using Python

This is a **console-based ATM simulation project** built in **Python**, where users can securely interact with an ATM interface. It simulates basic banking operations like balance check, deposit, and withdrawal after authenticating with a PIN.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure PIN Authentication**  
  Uses the `getpass` module to hide the PIN input for added realism and security.

  Displays the current account balance.

- 💸 **Withdraw Funds**  
  Allows users to withdraw an amount if sufficient balance exists.

- 💳 **Deposit Funds**  
  Users can deposit a valid amount to their account.

- ⏱ **Simulated Delay**  
  Includes a short delay to simulate card reading.
